Natural Language Identification Machine Learning Pipeline - Graduate Project
In this project, I pulled text data from European Parliament Proceedings in 21 languages. Using Scikit-Learn, I transformed the raw text into a numerical feature matrix, and trained a Multinomial naive bayes probability model to classify input language with greater than 99% accuracy.
